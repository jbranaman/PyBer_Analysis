# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of ride-sharing data such as rides, drivers and fares by city type and weekly totals.
### Purpose
This report presents an analysis of ride-sharing data in order to provide a summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
The data was organized to show the totals (rides, drivers & fares) and average fares (per ride & driver). The vast number of drivers, rides and consequently the total fares exist in urban cities while the least number of these exist in ruraly cities. As a result, the average fare per ride and driver are lower in urban cities and higher in rural cities.

The data was organized to create a line graph displaying the total weekly fares from the beginning of January 2019 to the end of April 2019 by city type. Across all city types the fares started at their lowest in the beginning of January and peaked the most towards the end of February. The most consistent fares while albeit the lowest were rural cities and the most varied fares while also the highest were in urban cities.

## Summary & Recommendations
* There is a significant disparity in the 'average fare per driver' between urban cities and suburban & rural cities. This is due to large number of total urban drivers compared to other city types against the number of rides. In both suburban and rural cities there are more rides than there are drivers while in urban cities there are drivers than rides. The recommendation would be to reduce the total number of drivers across urban cities.
* There is a disparity in the number of rides and subsequent total fares in rural cities creating a much larger 'average fare per driver'. The recommendation would be to consider increasing the number of drivers in rural cities and analyze if there is impact on the number of rides and total fares due to this increase.
* Considering the total fares of all city types side by side both suburban and rural total rides and fares are less than half of urban rides. While a number of uncontrollable factors could account for this it is recommended to compensate for any of the uncontrollable factors in order to increase total rides and fares. A possible way to compensate and increase total rides and fares could be to offer promotions and incentives to riders to take more rides in these city types.
