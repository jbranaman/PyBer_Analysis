# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
This is an analysis of ride-sharing data such as rides, drivers and fares by city type and weekly totals.
### Purpose
This report presents an analysis of ride-sharing data in order to provide a summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results
The data was organized to show the totals (rides, drivers & fares) and average fares (per ride & driver). The vast number of drivers, rides and consequently the total fares exist in urban cities while the least number of these exist in ruraly cities. As a result, the average fare per ride and driver are lower in urban cities and higher in rural cities.

The data was organized to create a line graph displaying the total weekly fares from the beginning of January 2019 to the end of April 2019 by city type. Across all city types the fares started at their lowest in the beginning of January and peaked the most towards the end of February. The most consistent fares while albeit the lowest were rural cities and the most varied fares while also the highest were in urban cities.
